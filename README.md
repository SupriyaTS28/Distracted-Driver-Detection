# Distracted-Driver-Detection
I.	Introduction
Distracted driving is defined as any activity that takes away your attention from driving whether it be talking on a cell phone, texting, operating a radio, eating, or talking to a passenger. In 2018, there were 2841 deaths and around 400,000 people in the United States injured as a result of crashes involving distracted drivers [3]. As there are several different forms of distracted driving, it is important to be able to recognize and correctly classify each of them in order to minimize car accidents.
We explore different deep learning techniques in order to build a high accuracy model that detects and correctly distinguishes between several distracted driving activities such as texting, talking on the phone, operating the radio, drinking, reaching behind, adjusting hair and makeup, and talking to a passenger.
